# Singly Linked List



* implement LinkedList in python in two classes: Node and LinkedList

* the LinkedList have the following method implemented in it:

    - add            (add a node to the end)
    - delete         (delete a node)
    - peek           (return the last item of the LinkedList)
    - push           (add a node to the front)
    - extend         (Add a single data or a list of data at the end of the Linked list)
	- insert_after   (Insert new data at a specific location )
	- search 
	- print backwards
    - print forwards

Ther is also a class method linkedlist(cls, head_data, *data),  which will transform a list of data into Linked List
